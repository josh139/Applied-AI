# Applied-AI
Here I have created an AI agent which controls the snake within the classic snake game. I have implemented this as a Jupyter notebook file. Within the file is a report 
which includes:

- An application area review
- A comparison and evaluation of AI techniques
- An implementation
- Testing
- And an evaluation of results

In order to run the Jupyter notebook file "BFS_snake.ipynb" enter the ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` command to set up the necessary libraries.

## A preview of the implementation:
